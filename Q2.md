  ### Difference between arrays and linked lists:

   1. **Memory allocation**

   - **Arrays** : It uses contiguous memory allocation ,where elements are stored in successive memory locations. 

   - **Linked Lists** :Use dynamic memory allocation,where each element (node) is stored anywhere in the  memory,Nodes are also    connected by  pointers hence eliminating the need for a fixed size. 

   2.  **Insertion and deletion**

   - **Arrays** : This operations require element shifting hence leading to linear time complexity (O(n)).
   
   - **Linked lists** :It is efficient since it only involves pointer adjustments,while middle operations require traversal (O(n)) in order to locate the insertion and deletion points.

   3. **Performance**

   - **Arrays** :Accessing elements is fast due to direct indexing  using their positioning.(O(n)) is used for unsorted arrays and (O(log n)) for sorted arrays using binary search.

   - **Linked lists** : Accessing elements is slow due to sequential traversal which results in linear time complexity(O(n)) 

   - In conclusion, arrays offer quick random access due to contiguous memory allocation, while linked lists offer more efficient insertions and deletions at the beginning or when working with dynamic data where frequent modifications are needed.
